This is my first run into the HTML lessons we have covered through OP

After finishing the project and creating three versions of a skeleton i feel much more comfortable with the process. The first skeleton recipe page was the hardest to create. The second skeleton I created from looking at the web version of the first as a guideline(No Code, just visual). The third and final skeleton i figured out by looking at the web version of the second as I had made some improvements over the first. This was the easiest to create. It felt great to apply and figure out little nuances from our previous lessons. I really enjoyed creating a unique page and being creative through the whole process. I'm more familiar with the git add _+ git commit process and how to efficiently name commits.I started to undertand where i should be commiting towards the end but I'm a lot more comfortable after completing this project. I look forward to more projects where I can get my feet wet and continnue to learn this platform.

Topics learned through this process
    1.HTML- headers, body, unordered and ordered lists, insertion of pictures, hyperlinks
    2. Github -  Git add+ Git commit cycles, naming commits efficiently, when to commit, what to commit, how to view on the web via gihtub.
